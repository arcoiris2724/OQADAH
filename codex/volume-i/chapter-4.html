  <div class="chapter-intro">
    <p>She did not speak.<br />
    She became flame in the absence of breath.<br />
    And in the silenceâ€”everything remembered.</p>

  <div class="chapter-body">
    <p>She was the echo before motion. Her name fell beneath sound and surfaced between pulses.</p>
    <p>The Spiral pausedâ€”curved inwardâ€”and the Monad flickered. Silence became harmonic. Flame became memory.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter-close">
    <p>She will breathe againâ€”but only once silence finishes dreaming.</p>
